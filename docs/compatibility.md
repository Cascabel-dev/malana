While this tool may be, and is likely to be, fully functional when run on any openSUSE Tumbleweed system, it has been tested and designed to run on a clean install.  Certain changes, tweaks, and steps have been designed and **exclusively** tested on fresh installations.  The configuration used when testing the script for compatibility and function is as follows:

OS: OpenSUSE Tumbleweed
Patterns: Base System, YaST Base Utilities, Minimal Appliance Base
Default systemd target: Text Mode
Major Linux Security Module: None

This is built for maximum compatibility and minimal conflict or overhead.  It also means, however, that Malana has not been thoroughly tested alongside other software or services.  If conflicts arrise, please either open an issue or a pull request with a valid solution.

Thank you.
